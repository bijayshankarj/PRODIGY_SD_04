# SudokuSolverGUI
Solves sudoku problem using QT interface, utilized multithreading for displaying the recrussion solution

First practice using multithreading to show the recursion process and allows for a very nice demonstration of how recursion works. 
This project has the ability to do a lot more functions as well but I have not done much. Can be a good testing bench as well. 



Future Ideas: 

Add a counter to show how many possible solutions exist for a given board that updates on idle.

Go through different solutions

Randomly generate a sudoku board with different difficulties (easy,medium,hard) based on how many initial cells are given.
